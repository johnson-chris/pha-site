<p>
The Parke House Academy 's objective  is to prepare and maintain a positive and stimulating learning environment that challenges each student to reach the height of educational excellence. The quality learning materials and equipment that have been selected enhance our exceptional curriculum. We are traditional in our content, but young and innovative in our style. The Parke House Academy’s curriculum is advanced. All grade levels work from instructional materials in Language Arts ,  Reading , and Mathematics  that are one grade level higher. Basic skill acquisition, mastery, and application are taught, practiced, reinforced, and rewarded throughout the curriculum. </p>
<br>
<p>
Our approach to curriculum is based on the following principals that dominate research and create a balanced program of instruction. Integration of basic and higher order thinking skills is a key element throughout our curriculum. Opportunities to learn beyond traditional age/grade expectations are encouraged and abundant. Informal assessments of individual abilities, interests, needs, and learning styles help shape the curriculum. </p>
<br>
<p>                    
A foundation in phonics with a wide variety of reading materials is incorporated to produce strong readers. Writing is taught as a process of brainstorming, composing, revising and editing. Students build on their informal knowledge in mathematics and use their perception of numbers in flexible and creative ways as our mathematics instruction is not presented as a series of isolated facts. Science is taught and learned as a result of exploration, observation¸ prediction¸ experimentation and evaluation. Social Studies is used as a catalyst to encourage exploration of our world, its people, and their cultures. State-of-the-art technology and stimulating software is incorporated into the curriculum to produce computer literate students ready to accept the challenges of our ever changing world.

                    <p>The Parke House Academy Technology Curriculum ensures that every student will become technological literate, and thereby, able to use, manage, and understand technology and it's value in our global society.
The Academy is equipped with two separate computer labs. Our Lower Division students ( preschool- prekindergarten) learn the basic computers skills such as mouse function, keyboard recognition, and an introduction to typing. These basic computer skills at a young age build a strong foundation. In Upper Division, students will explore technology through our Mac Lab; participating in PowerPoint presentations, iMovies, decoding, and gaming software.  
The iPad cart and iPads are integrated in the classrooms from preschool to fifth grade. Classrooms are equipped with 50' flat screen televisions that host the latest Apple Television Technology engaging students as a whole, researching, and conducting well written essays. 
<br>
<p>"We need technology in every classroom and in every student and teacher's hand, because it is the pen and paper of our time, and it is the lends through which we experience much of our world."</p>
